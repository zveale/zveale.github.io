		<h1>Information</h1>
		<p class="info">&emsp;I have been working on this project since summer 2019. The theme is a spooky space station that the player has to explore and survive. Most of my projects before this one have been small 2D games so I wanted to branch out and learn what I could about 3D graphics. The game is written in C/C++ with rendering in OpenGL and windowing/input using SDL. I used SoLoud for the audio library along with many other resources to help me implement the game.
		   <br>&emsp;I started with Blinnâ€“Phong shading model and recently transitioned to a physically-based implementation. The models for the 3D scene were part of a kitbash set that I assembled into different scenes in blender. I used Assimp to export all the models into the several scenes so that I could occlude them. The soft shadows are sampled from a jitter map and there is support for dynamic and static directional/spot lights.
		   <br>&emsp;The AI is A* where the nodes are created from a binary file. Animations can be loaded in from blender,  the enemy was created and rigged by an artist and loaded directly in with little modification.
