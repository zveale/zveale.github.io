		<h1>Information</h1>
		<p class="info">&emsp;I have been working on this project in free time since summer 2019. Most of my projects before this one have been small 2D games so I wanted to branch out and learn what I could about 3D graphics. It is written in C/C++ with rendering in OpenGL, windowing/input using SDL and SoLoud for the audio library. In the scene above I was going for a spooky space station kind of vibe.
		   <br>&emsp;I started with Blinn–Phong shading model and recently converted to a physically-based implementation. The models for the 3D scene were part of a kitbash set that I assembled into different scenes in blender. I used Assimp to export all the models into the several scene parts so that I could occlude them. The soft shadows are sampled from a jitter map and there is support for dynamic and static directional/spot lights. The scene has a reflection probe in the center that is used to sample colors for the diffuse and specular IBL. There is also 4x MSAA, HDR and bloom.
		   <br>&emsp;The AI is A* where the nodes are created from a binary file. Animations can be loaded in from blender,  the enemy was created and rigged by an artist and loaded directly in with little modification. The view point is primarily a first-person camera but there is also support for a more cinematic spline camera that follows a list of points. Right now the audio just has support for 2D SFX and BGM but i plan to implement 3D audio. This project has morphed over time and is more like an engine.  When I find something I am interested in I find that the best way to help me understand it is to implement it.

		<h1>Information</h1>
		<p class="info">&emsp;My brother and I worked on this for our game programming class. It took 10 weeks to complete. It was our first time using unity but there is a ton of documentation online to get us up to speed. This game was inspired by kirby’s dream course for super nintendo.
		   <br>&emsp;I worked on the levels and UI excluding the main UI overlay for each level. I worked on intro scene, pause scene, ending scene including all the logic to switch between each scene. I created the levels in blender and added lights and reflection probes to the scene along with logic for game objects. Besides the level creation I made the laser which was probably the most entertaining thing to make. This project was a lot of fun and my brother and I hope to work on another project again in the future.
