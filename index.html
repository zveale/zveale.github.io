	<h2>Video games have always been an important part of my life. <br>Growing up with three brothers, video games kept us out of trouble most days. Today, while distance may separate us, video games allow us to stay connected. My love of video games and creative spirit drove me to pursue an education that will allow me to create video games and pay my bills. I enjoy most aspects of game development and have focused my learning on graphics and systems programming. My goal is learn and to contribute to video games at a professional level.</h2>
